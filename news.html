                                <p>Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Head of Technical Research at Sharekhan said that the hourly momentum indicator has been pushed into the oversold zone and has developed a positive divergence. "Unless Monday's low of 17,280 breaks, Nifty50 can attempt a bounce to test its key hourly moving averages near 17,700," he said.</p>
                            <p>Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said Nifty50 seems to be nearing its critical support levels, which are placed in the 17,150–17,000 range. "The last 22 trading sessions of fall from the highs of 18,604 levels seems to have carved out a descending channel, which will be confirmed if Nifty50 manages to defend 17,280-level on a closing basis on Tuesday,” he said.</p>
                            <p>MUMBAI: Nifty50 formed a large bearish candle on the daily chart on Monday as the market succumbed to losses for the fourth successive session and failed to sustain above the 50-day moving average.</p>

                        <p>NEW DELHI: Nifty50 on Monday could not sustain 50-day EMA and saw heavy selling pressure. In the process, it declined for the fourth straight session and formed a large bearish candle on the daily chart. Analysts said the index has support at 17,280 level and at its 100-day moving average, which is placed around 17,150 level. They see the 17,500 level as the immediate resistance level for the index.</p>
